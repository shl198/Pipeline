Differential expression pipeline:

1. run fastqc to check quality of fastq files.
2. run trimmomatic to remove low qulity bases and adapter. shortest read length set as 36.
3. run GSNAP to do the alignment, get sam file, usually use default parameters.
4. run samtools to convert sam file to bam and sort bam file based on coordinates.
5. run htseq-count to get the read count profile.
6. run DESeq2 to do differential expression analysis, usually log2Foldchange=0.58,p-value=0.05
